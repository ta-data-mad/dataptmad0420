# Who am I: 
> I am a junior architect with a background on sustainabity consultancy and parametric modelling.

# Where are you from? 
> I am from Madrid

# What do you do? 
> I teach architectural technology for MHab-ETSAM students at a local academy (or i did before that current state of events).

# Do you have previous experience with technology/data? 
> Not really. I have proffesional experience with BIM and parametric modelling; I have also completed recently  a proffessional course on web programming with python + django/flask and some html/css; but no experience outside that month on classes.

# Why am I here. 
> I want to refocus my career since data science services are becoming a thing on BIM; although if I do not find something along this path I am seriously considering focusing on working for any tech company that allows me to retain the kwoledge and habilities that I am about to learn.

# What has brought you to Ironhack? 
> A very interesting conversation for an engineering firm about future job opportunities make me realize that my current job wasn't in future that I wanted for my career and that being somebody with a technology background that goes beyond parametric design / bim modelling is going to become increasingly more relevant in my field.

# What knowledge/skills do you expect to learn in this bootcamp?

>1. stadistics
>2. how to make projects from scratch (how people work etc, how to manage a new project, etc)
>3. Lots of programming! I already have a basic level, but i need more. Also, the hability to learn new lenguages and how to face being clueless at new technologies.
>4. Machine Learning, IA and its possibilities 
>5. How to remain and mantain the hability to be up to date and where to find new material to study when needed.

# What will I do after the bootcamp?
>I do not think about the future at the present time. Everything is very ephemeral until the COVID crisis is resolved.
I just wnat to enjoy the time, make the most out of this opportunity and be as optimistic about the future as one can be.

# Which industry will you seek employment in?
>First, in AEC industry, since architecture is my first love; but I am open to whatever opportunity comes my way that would make me a better programmer.

# What will your future role look like?
>I dont know. Rather than a role, I rather focus on being somewhere where i get along with my coworkers and I feel appreciated proffesionally.

# What is your career goal?
>I dont have a particular goal at the moment. 
I am a very curious person, I like trying new things and learn; so I am open to a very broad spectrum of careers and possibilities.
