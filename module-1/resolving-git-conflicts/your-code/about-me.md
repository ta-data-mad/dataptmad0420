I'm Victor Lucia

I'm form Caba√±as de Ebro, a little town near Zaragoza
I was working in Hyphen until March. Now, I'm unemployed
I have no experience with data management

I'm here because I want to make a change in my professional life

The spirit of always learning
I expect to learn a lot about Data analytics 

Look for a job in the sector

Specially I will seek in specialiced Data industries to improve my knowledge
I think that Data analyst will be a good role, but i'm still not sure about it because of my weak experience in the Data field
Achieve a good job as data analyst, improve my knowledge with experienced colleagues and come back in the future to the architecture field to apply this knowledge.
