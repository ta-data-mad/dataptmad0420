# Who am I



* Where are you from? Madrid

* What do you do? I work as an Innovation and Content Manager at Mindshare

* Do you have previous experience with technology/data? NO



# Why am I here



* What has brought you to Ironhack? I want to give a boost to my technological capabilities and for that I looked for the site with the best references.

* What knowledge/skills do you expect to learn in this bootcamp?

I would like to reach the knowledge and skills to develop learning models that facilitate decision making both in business and in people's lives.





# What will I do after the bootcamp?



* Which industry will you seek employment in? I would love to achieve enough knowledge to bring innovation in the area of health and wellness. I also think I may have some good ideas in the field of home applications

* What will your future role look like? I think I'm looking at a double way. On the one hand, leading a Data team in a tecnological company and on the other hand I am experimenting on my own, trying to create "independent" products.
